# PROJECT-based-on-HTML-CSS
I recently built a basic yet visually engaging café webpage called “THE 29th CAFE” using only HTML and CSS. This project was created as part of my practice in frontend web development. 🏅 

The Images used in this webpage is having issue for uploading in GitHub you can get your own images from the web or by generatio=ng it through AI.
